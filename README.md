# Searching similar images by VAE

## Project Description

The source code includes a Variational Autoencoders project, which is an applied task: Web server for Searching similar images in a docker.
The VAE model was trained using the Fruits 360 dataset: A dataset of images containing fruits and vegetables. (https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)

The project has the following goals
* Design document and dataset description
* VAE Model implementation and training code providing by Jupiter Notebook
* Flask Server and HTML Frontend Client providing
* Training model from scratch by a dataset
* Compile docker and docker-compose for full architecture

## Running the Demo

You can run the app directly, or through docker and docker-compose.
To get the access to the web-front open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

```
gh repo clone galkinc/VAE-Searching-similar-images
cd VAE-Searching-similar-images
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
